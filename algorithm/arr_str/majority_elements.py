LeetCode - 169
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
